# Projects
This repository contains projects that I have worked on and details on how they work.

 **DNDBoard**
 
Purpose:

I created this project by as an entry for my school's hackathon under the cybersecurity category.
 
Language:

Python

**Password Creator:**

Overview:

This project deals with security for passwords and usernames. Rather than storing users passwords in a database, this algorithm instead stores an encoded version of the password. A version of the Vigenere cypher is used to do so. This is useful, as if the data becomes compromised, the infiltrators do not have access to the actual login information but instead a coded version. Also included in my demo is an intruder catcher which would contact the company in the event that an encoded password is used in place of the normal password. Though this is a basic demo, it can be improved and adjusted as needed to incorporate hashing or other types of cyphers.
